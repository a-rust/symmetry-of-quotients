# Symmetry of quotients

Some short animations to showcase the symmetry of certain equivalence relations plotted over $\mathbf{R}^2$.

## Examples
Consider the ring $Z$ and its ideal $3Z$. We define the quotient ring $Z/3Z := \{[a] : [a]\in$ ~ $\}$, where ~ is the equivalence relation that $x$~$y$ iff $(x-y) \in 3Z$.
* $Z/3Z = \{[0], [1], [2]\}$.

### TODO

- [âœ“] Small scale symmetry of the quotient ring $Z/3Z$
- [ ] Small scale symmetry for the generalized quotient ring $Z/nZ$
- [ ] Small scale symmetry of residue fields $R/M$ for some ring $R$ and some maximal ideal $M$ of $R$
